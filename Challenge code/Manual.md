## Step 3 - Using the menus
  Now that the application already authorized, you can use the two options available 'Check Attendance' and 'Grade Situation Checker'
  ### Check Attendance
  As the name says when clicked, it checks if the student will fail due to absence and puts this in their situation
  ### Grid Situation Checker
  The grade situation checker, on the other hand, in addition to checking whether the student will fail due to absence, also checks the grades and, if necessary, the grade that must be achieved to obtain approval.
